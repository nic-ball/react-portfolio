     As a self taught Full Stack Developer, find learning new skills and then being able to implement them one of the most satisfying things. \
     When I was starting out there were many times of information overload and frustratio. Now that I have a good understanding of Software Development and the tools used, I find that I can process new information in a more succinct manner.'
